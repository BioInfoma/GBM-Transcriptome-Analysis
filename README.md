TCGA GBM Transcriptome Analysis

This project analysed the TCGA Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) transcriptome dataset. It includes data preprocessing, differential expression analysis, visualization, enrichment analysis, and machine learning for tumor subtype classification.

This analysis focuses on the TCGA-GBM dataset, performing transcriptome profiling, normalization, differential expression analysis (DEA), visualization (heatmap, PCA), and enrichment analysis. Additionally, machine learning techniques are applied to predict tumor subtypes based on gene expression data.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure that you have installed R and RStudio on your system. You should also have access to the TCGA dataset.
